# Description
A (heavily) KER inspired mod to give you some additional information on your missions.

Flight:
* You can enable and disable individual sections and pop them out into their own window or create your own window containing only the information you want to see.

VAB:
* See stage info for your vessel - TWR, deltaV, burn time

# Installation
Extract the contents of the .zip into your KSP2 installation folder.

Mod folder will be placed in ..\Kerbal Space Program 2\BepInEx\plugins\

# Usage
* While in flight or VAB, open the mod window by clicking its entry on the APP BAR
* Or press CTRL + E to toggle windows

### Flight:
* Pop out windows and drag the where you want
* Minimize the main window to hide irrelevant data
* Popped out windows will snap to each other when being near
* Open Edit windows by clicking on the gear icon
* Edit windows:
  * add or remove any entry from any window any way you like
  * reorder entries inside the window
  * create new custom windows/huds with information you want
  * rename any window, rename any entry
  * change number of decimal digits for each entry
  * lock a window to prevent accidental dragging
* Double-clicking an entry that displays a speed will change to an alternate unit: km/h
### VAB:
* See deltav, TWR, sea level deltav, sea level TWR and burn time for each stage
* Set a different celestial body for each stage to see what TWR and deltav you'll get on that body
